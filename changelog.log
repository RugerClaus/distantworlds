Alpha 0.1.0 ---- LOG

Okay, here we go again. This is the official reboot for https://github.com/rugerclaus/infinite
I have an official title now. I have began the rework with a fresh repo for saving myself time and pain. I have started out with a state machine to manage all the 
app states. I have laid the foundation for keeping track of the state of everything in the game. Especially entities. No game logic, but there is definitely a great structure
here and I think this will bring me to a point where I can finally full integrate game mechanics properly and cleanly. 

Give it up for Distant Worlds

Alpha 0.1.1 ---- LOG

You can now do something other than view a menu. There is now music, and the sound engine has been implemented almost fully and is extensible. I have made it possible to
pause the game, toggle the music and sound effects in the pause menu, and the state is constantly logged. Created directory for logs as well as a state log file, which I'd like
to use to log state changes and save it as a new log. Perhaps dump the logs that are older than 5 iterations. The structure of the program is far more streamlined in this
version unlike the "infinite" repository. 

Ultimately this is panning out to be superior for scalability.

Alpha 0.1.2 ---- LOG

You can now enter the game, play around with the player. There is some jumping and movement mechanics and a level changing mechanic. Gotta figure out how to place 
the door correctly, but it's just an offset. Beyond that, you can switch to the second world (jungle) and I have integrated a ton of world mechanics. There is a LevelManager 
to handle the level and transitions. There is a world class where every level is a world. There can be unlimited worlds. There will be world data at some point that direct most 
of the world properties like objects, entities and obstacles.
